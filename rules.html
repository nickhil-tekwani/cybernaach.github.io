                <h3>Rules and Regulations</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Dancers must be current undergraduate students or recent
                    graduates. Alumni may help create choreo (see rule 4 on
                    biting), but the performances must be done by the competing
                    dancers.
                    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
                      <li>
                        Since CyberNaach was founded on the principle of
                        adapting the circuit to a COVID world, we empathize with
                        the Class of 2020 who may not have had an opportunity to
                        participate in their senior year dance season. As a
                        result, Alumni from the Class of 2020 may perform with
                        their undergraduate team, up to a maximum of 20% of the
                        competing perfomers of the team.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
                    No dancer may be repeated in the bracket for two (2) rounds.
                    This means that a dancer who participates in round 1 may not
                    participate again until round 4. (This also means that your
                    team requires a minimum of 7 dancers)
                  </li>
                  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
                    Teams have the option to "shuffle" the mix of one (1)
                    assigned segment throughout the whole competition. A team
                    who wishes to use their "shuffle" must notify the board
                    within 24 hours of the mix being assigned. Requests to
                    shuffle the segment may be considered after 24 hours, up to
                    the discretion of the board and the opposing team.
                  </li>
                  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
                    Choreography should be created in-house as much as possible.
                    Performances should not be reused (without permission from
                    original creators) and should not be old choreo (even if
                    it's your own teams old choreo). If choreo is reused or
                    borrowed from other performances (including if the original
                    choreographer gives permission), it is up to the judges'
                    discretion for removing points from the
                    "Originality/Creativity" section of the rubric.
                  </li>
                  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
                    Videos must be submitted by the deadlines. Any delays in
                    submission may result in disqualification, up to the
                    discretion of the competition board. This rule exists to
                    provide smooth, timely proceeding of the competition as well
                    as no unfair advantage to any team since everyone is given
                    the same amount of time to submit videos.
                  </li>
                  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
                    All dancers must be above the age of 18; however, exceptions
                    may be granted on a case-by-case basis by the board. Reach
                    out to the board with any questions.

                  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
                    Videos must be high quality (at least 720p), one angle, in
                    landscape orientation, and steady (no movement of camera).
                  </li>
                  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
                    Dancers may not have costumes, team or university gear, or
                    any other university affiliation clearly visible in the
                    frame of the video.
                  </li>
                  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
                    No video editing of any kind.

                  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
                    If the choreo exceeds the length provided, or is outside the
                    segment that was assigned, it will be cut off and judges
                    will not be able to view that part of the video. If choreo
                    is shorter than the segment assigned, points will be
                    deducted from the performance score. Judges will only judge
                    the dance that is submitted within the segments assigned.
                  </li>
                  <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
                    If not enough teams sign up for the competition by the
                    deadline (and any extensions), the competition will not take
                    place, and teams will be refunded their registration fees.
